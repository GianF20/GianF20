- 👋 Hi, I’m @GianF20
- 👀 I’m an enthusiastic follower of technology and committed to continuous learning.The reason why I trained in the proper use of data analysis tools such
 as Excel, SQL, and, of course, Power BI is to develop my professional career in people analytics. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python
- 💞️ I’m looking to contribute to the people analysis area, but I am also interested in the sales area to apply my knowledge in data analysis.
